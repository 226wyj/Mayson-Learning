# Mayson Learning

Hi, welcome to my learning repo!

I am going to share my study materials here. If you find any mistake, please kindly discuss with me. Thanks!

I am currently working on CS 189/289A Introduction to Machine Learning by professor Jonathan Shewchuk @ UC Berkeley (Spring 2019). The course website can be found [here](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/189/).
